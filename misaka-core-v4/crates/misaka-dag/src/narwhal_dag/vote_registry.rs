//! VoteRegistry — tracks votes per leader with equivocation detection.
//!
//! ## Problem (CRIT)
//!
//! Previous: votes stored in `HashMap<AuthorityIndex, BlockRef>`. If an
//! authority voted twice (equivocation), the second vote silently overwrote
//! the first. This meant equivocation evidence was destroyed.
//!
//! ## Fix
//!
//! Store votes in `BTreeMap` and detect duplicate keys. When a duplicate
//! is found with a different BlockRef, return `VoteEquivocation`.
//!
//! This module is used by the commit pipeline whenever votes (blocks at
//! round R+1 referencing a leader at round R) are aggregated.

// NOTE: StakeAggregator<BlockRef, QuorumThreshold> provides the same
// functionality as this module. Consider migrating in a future refactor.
// The current impl is retained for API stability.
