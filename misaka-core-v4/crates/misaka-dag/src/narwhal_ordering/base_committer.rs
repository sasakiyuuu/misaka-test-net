//! BaseCommitter — direct and indirect commit decisions.
//!
//! Sui equivalent: consensus/core/base_committer.rs (~1,200 lines)
//!
//! The base committer implements the core Bullshark commit rule:
//! - Direct commit: leader has ≥2f+1 votes in round+1
//! - Indirect commit: leader certified through vote chains from a later
//!   committed leader's causal history
//! - Skip: a later committed leader does NOT have this leader in its
//!   causal history
//!
//! ## CRIT-3 fix: Indirect commit is now a real path
//! ## CRIT-4 fix: Skip only decided by a committed anchor, not by
//!   mere existence of quorum blocks
